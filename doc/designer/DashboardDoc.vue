            Dashboard is the entry point of the designer. The license key can be configured at this view before getting started with the full set of features. In the <b>My Themes</b> section, you're able to create a theme, and manage existing themes.
            A theme can be renamed, duplicated and downloaded using the <i class="pi pi-ellipsis-h !text-sm"></i> button.
